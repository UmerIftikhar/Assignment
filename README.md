# Test Swap Button:
Stops:  
1-- stopName:  Keskustori M, stopId: 0001  
2-- stopName:  Hervantakeskus, stopId: 3642  

# Other Working Stops:
1-- stopName:  Aleksis Kiven katu, stopId: 0070  
2-- stopName:  Lapinniemen kylpyl√§, stopId: 5018  



# Working:
1-- When the page is loaded, function updateAllBuses() is called from the controller "manageStops".  
2-- updateAllBuses() calls the $interval(function(){ updateTheData(); }, 2500), where updateTheData() updates the position of every individual bus every 2.5 seconds.  
3-- loadAll() is also called from the controller SearchCtrl on page load. It get all the stops Names and Ids from the Nodejs Server. Later, the data is used for search purposes.  
4-- querySearch() is used to filter out the data as the user types the input stops in the search fields.  
5-- search() from the controller SearchCtrl is called when the user clicks the SEARCH button. retrieveShortestRoute.js file is used to make queries to find shortest path from the server.  
6-- Once the Path is retrieved, service.js file is used to plot all the bus stops and paths from the retrieved data.  
7-- reset() function clear all the form data and errors and also remove all paths and directions from the Map.
